Weird Sound p0: how sounds move|||20160223|||nUsing just a computer to manipulate audio tracks, how does one make a sound sound as if it were coming from a specific direction? Lets talk about this in really simple terms, and say a sound is emitted from a source, and it travels along two paths, one path to each ear. This isnt exactly true, but its true enough for this paper. A sound that is emitted to the left of a listener, would arrive at their left ear first, and then a small fraction of a second later at the right ear.

So, lets say you are wearing head phones connected a computer. You are listening to an audio track thats being played in both the left and the right speakers of your head phones. If one wanted to use a computer to simulate how an audio track B would sound if it were coming to you (the listener) from the left, one should delay the rights track by a very small amount of time. Here is some ascii art to show you what I mean.


Audio Track B to both ears

L |...{-----------B-----------}
R |...{-----------B-----------}
..---------------------------------
...............time


Audio Track B as if it were coming from the left

L |...{------------B----------}
R |.....{------------B----------}
..---------------------------------
...............time

Sure enough, delaying the right channel by 1 milisecond will give the effect of the sound coming from the left.|||nWhat if we want to take this a step further and simulate a sound moving around? Well to do that, we have to vary the amount that the right channel is delayed from the left channel. A right channel delayed 0 relative to the left would sound like it was coming from straight in front of the listener. If d is our variable for delay, and its a function of time, then as time increases, d has to decrease. If d starts off as 1 milisecond delayed from the left channel, it should end at -1 milisecond delayed from the left channel. Ill draw that below.

Maybe whats amazing about this is not obvious to you. Weve been talking about audio track B, a particular sound that is played to both the left and right ears. Audio track B played faster, does not sound the same as audio track B played at a normal speed. At least, so I would have thought. I would have thought, that two audio tracks of different frequency or duration are necessarily different sounds, and that two different sounds are necessarily heard differently. Apparently not. Apparently, when one plays B, and something that is not B, to your left and right ears, it sounds like B moving, rather than sounding like B and something that is not B. 

Remember, what each ear is each hearing, and whats different about what its hearing relative to the other is important. If one played B and a slightly faster version of B to both ears simultaneously, the effect of motion goes away entirely. But if one ear hears B and the other ear hears faster B, then it sounds as if it is moving.|||nSo how does this correspond to reality? In reality, when I hear a moving object, I am not hearing some clean audio track and a computer manipulated version in each ear. So whats going on?

When one hears an object moving, each of their ears is experiencing a doppler-like effect that is specific to each ear. One ear gets the signal first, but as the object moves, it biases the rate at which an ear detects its sound. Since each ear is positioned differently in space, each ear is hearing differently doppler-effected versions of the same sound. An object to my left, moving to my right, is moving towards my right ear at a higer rate than it is moving to my left ear. The frequency of the sound coming from the object as it moves, changes over time, but it changes differently for each ear.

Its not the frequency that matters, or even the different rates of frequency change specific to each ear. Neither of these are how our ear detects motion. The fact that the rate of change for the frequencies heard by each ear are never the same, the audio content is 'crammed' into time; and because the right ear is hearing the same content 'faster', it can 'lap' the left ear, and become the ear that first receives the sound of the moving object.
